  <h3>Continuous API Monitoring & Drift Detection</h3>
  <p><em>Catch breaking changes before they impact your users</em></p>
</div>

**DriftWatch** is a powerful CLI tool that continuously monitors your API endpoints and detects when their actual behavior drifts from their documented specifications. It helps development teams catch breaking changes, undocumented modifications, and API evolution before they impact downstream consumers.
